1. A calculator.Section 1.1 uses the system as a calculator. Let us explore the
possibilities:

(a) Calculate the exact value of 2^100 without using any new functions.Try to think of shortcuts to do it without having to type 2*2*2*...*2 with one hundred 2s. Hint: use variables to store intermediate results.
(b) Calculate the exact value of 100! without using any new functions.Are there any possible shortcuts in this case?



(a) 

declare V = 2*2*2*2*2*2*2*2*2*2
{Browse V*V*V*V*V*V*V*V*V*V}

(b)

There is no shortcut for calculating 100! without defining a function to save yourself from having to type 1x2x3x4...x100.
